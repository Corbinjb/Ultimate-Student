Summary: Made by college students, The Ultimate Student provides users with the opportunity to grapple with the difficult questions facing college students today. The Ultimate Student then uses their responses to simulate their performance in social, personal and academic contexts in college. Users can replay the process as many times as they desire, each time gaining increased intuition on the pros and cons of various choices they will likely face during their college years. This product provides a tool for students to help decide how they want to allocate their time in order to attain an optimal work-play balance during their collegiate career. Additionally, the game can be an environment for those who have completed their higher education to relive their college glory days and see how the choices they made affected their experience. 

Users: Students, Teachers, Avid Gamers

MVP: A working student (stick figure animation) that can answer questions about college life and a scorekeeping feature so that the user can see how their GPA, Social Life, and Hours of Sleep are affected by their choices. The scorekeeping will be bars that show how well you are doing on each respective scale (0-4.0 for GPA, for example). Questions may include things such as: Given the choice of studying for an exam next week or going to a beer pong tournament, which do you choose?
