Summary: Made by college students, College Knowledge enables users with the opportunity to share their most memorable experiences in college with other users. Users can read life advice from weathered graduates, giggle as they read about their friends' collegiate escapades, and for the youngsters, they can begin to learn how to succeed as they embark on their college journey. College Knowledge features a comment option for users to respond to posts they find particularly intriguing. This feature allows for dialogue between the poster and the commenter. Come join the hilarious conversations going on College Knowledge!

Users: Students, Professors

MVP: A user can login, and can immediately begin posting new stories, commenting on others stories, and deleting comments and stories as needed. Users that don't sign in can only view stories and comments to prevent any scamming from any malicious threats.

Functionality: College Knowledge is the best place to share college stories. We connect users by providing a secure and transparent system of writing stories and comments. We safeguard the platform with a username and password given in our installation steps. Additionally we allow users to view other comments and add to the conversation in an effort to analyze some of the greatest college stories.

Installation Steps: Download the project's files from the GitHub repo above, and open a rails server while in the project's directory. Search localhost:3000/stories, and input the username:ultimate and password:student to begin using College Knowledge. 

Issues: Time constraint was our biggest issue for two of the members of our team were away for the weekend for an ultimate frisbee tournament without internet. While we had to endure this setback, we managed to achieve a solid MVP in time. As of the time of this writing our biggest bug is our difficulties pushing our project to our repository. Our source code is on a computer with a forked version of our repository, and we are encountering difficulties pushing it to the forked repository.
